                  area of research in number theory. In this paper
                  we consider Mordell equations, which are of the
                  form y2=x3+d, where d is a (given) nonzero integer
                  number and all solutions in integers x and y have
                  to be determined. One non-elementary approach for
                  this problem is the resolution via descent and
                  class groups. Along these lines we formalized in
                  Lean 3 the resolution of Mordell equations for
                  several instances of d&lt;0. In order to achieve
                  this, we needed to formalize several other
                  theories from number theory that are interesting
                  on their own as well, such as ideal norms,
                  quadratic fields and rings, and explicit
                  computations of the class number. Moreover, we
                  introduced new computational tactics in order to
                  carry out efficiently computations in quadratic
                  rings and beyond.},

                  there are no faceshare-free tilings of
                  d-dimensional space by translates of a
                  d-dimensional cube. In 2020, Brakensiek et al.
                  resolved this 90-year-old conjecture by proving
                  that the largest number of dimensions for which no
                  faceshare-free tilings exist is 7. This result, as
                  well as many others pertaining to Keller’s
                  conjecture, critically relies on a reduction from
                  Keller’s original conjecture to a statement about
                  cliques in generalized Keller graphs. In this
                  paper, we present a formalization of this
                  reduction in the Lean 3 theorem prover.
                  Additionally, we combine this formalized reduction
                  with the verification of a large clique in the
                  Keller graph G8 to obtain the first verified
                  end-to-end proof that Keller’s conjecture is false
                  in 8 dimensions.},

  abstract =     {In differential topology and geometry, the
                  h-principle is a property enjoyed by certain
                  construction problems. Roughly speaking, it states
                  that the only obstructions to the existence of a
                  solution come from algebraic topology. We describe
                  a formalisation in Lean of the local h-principle
                  for first-order open and ample partial
                  differential relations. This is a significant
                  result in differential topology, originally proven
                  by Gromov in 1973 as part of his sweeping effort
                  which greatly generalised many previous
                  flexibility results in geometry. In particular it
                  reproves Smale’s celebrated sphere eversion
                  theorem, a visually striking and counter-intuitive
                  construction. Our formalisation uses
                  Theilli\`{e}re’s implementation of convex
                  integration from 2018. This paper reports on the
                  first part of the sphere eversion project
                  formalising the global version of the h-principle
                  for open and ample first order differential
                  relations, for maps between smooth manifolds. The
                  local version for vector spaces described in this
                  paper is the main ingredient of this proof, and is
                  sufficient to prove the titular corollary of the
                  project. From a broader perspective, the goal of
                  this project is to show that one can formalise
                  advanced mathematics with a strongly geometric
                  flavour and not only algebraically-flavoured
                  mathematics.},
